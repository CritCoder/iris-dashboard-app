# Authentication Redirect Fix

## Problem
Users were getting stuck on the login page after successful API authentication. The API calls were successful (200 responses), but the authentication flow wasn't properly redirecting users to the dashboard.

## Root Cause
The `AuthProvider` was missing logic to redirect authenticated users away from login pages. It only had logic to redirect unauthenticated users TO login pages, but not the reverse.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Added Redirect Logic in AuthProvider
**File**: `/contexts/auth-context.tsx`

Added a new `useEffect` that monitors authentication state and redirects authenticated users away from public routes:

```typescript
// Redirect authenticated users away from login pages
useEffect(() => {
  if (!isLoading && user && token && isPublicRoute) {
    console.log('User is authenticated, redirecting from', pathname, 'to dashboard')
    router.push('/')
  }
}, [isLoading, user, token, isPublicRoute, pathname, router])
```

### 2. Fixed Loading State Management
**Problem**: After successful authentication, `isLoading` remained `true`, preventing the redirect logic from triggering.

**Solution**: Added `setIsLoading(false)` in both `login` and `otpLogin` functions after setting authentication data:

```typescript
// In login function
setToken(newToken)
setUser(userData)
setOrganization(orgData)
setVerificationAttempts(0)
setIsLoading(false) // ← Added this

// In otpLogin function
setToken(newToken)
setUser(userData)
setOrganization(orgData)
setVerificationAttempts(0)
setIsLoading(false) // ← Added this
```

### 3. Correct Redirect Destination
**Issue**: Initially tried to redirect to `/dashboard`, but the dashboard is actually at `/` (root).

**Fix**: Changed redirect destination to `/`:
```typescript
router.push('/') // Main dashboard page
```

## Authentication Flow Now Works As Expected

1. ✅ User enters credentials/OTP
2. ✅ API call succeeds (200 response)
3. ✅ Auth data is stored in localStorage and state
4. ✅ `isLoading` is set to `false`
5. ✅ Redirect logic triggers automatically
6. ✅ User is redirected to dashboard (`/`)
7. ✅ Dashboard loads with `ProtectedRoute` protection

## Files Modified
- `/contexts/auth-context.tsx` - Added redirect logic and fixed loading state

## Testing
To test the fix:
1. Try logging in with valid credentials
2. Verify that after successful authentication, you're automatically redirected to the dashboard
3. Check browser console for the redirect log message
4. Confirm you can no longer access login pages when authenticated
