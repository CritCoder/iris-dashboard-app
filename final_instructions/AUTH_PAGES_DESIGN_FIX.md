# Authentication Pages Design Fix

## Issue
The authentication pages were showing a broken design due to layout wrapper constraints that were interfering with the full-screen design.

## Root Cause
The `ClientLayout` component was wrapping all public routes (including auth pages) in a container with `h-screen` and `overflow-hidden` classes, which was constraining the natural flow of the auth pages and preventing them from displaying at full size with centered forms.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed ClientLayout Component
**File:** `components/layout/client-layout.tsx`

- **Changed:** Removed the wrapper div for public routes
- **Before:** Public routes were wrapped in `<div className="h-screen bg-background text-foreground flex overflow-hidden w-full">`
- **After:** Public routes now render without any wrapper constraints using `<>{children}</>`
- **Impact:** Auth pages can now render with their own full-screen styling without interference

### 2. Updated Authentication Pages Design

#### Login Page (`app/login/page.tsx`)
