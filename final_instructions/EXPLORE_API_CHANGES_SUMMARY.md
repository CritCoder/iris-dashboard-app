## API Endpoints Implemented

### Entities APIs
1. ✅ `GET /api/social/entities/analytics` - Get entity analytics
2. ✅ `GET /api/social/entities/top/:type` - Get top entities by type
3. ✅ `GET /api/social/entities/search` - Search entities
4. ✅ `GET /api/social/entities/:id` - Get entity details

### Locations APIs
1. ✅ `GET /api/social/locations/analytics` - Get location analytics
2. ✅ `GET /api/social/locations/top` - Get top locations
3. ✅ `GET /api/social/locations/search` - Search locations
4. ✅ `GET /api/social/locations/:id` - Get location details
5. ✅ `GET /api/social/locations/multiple` - Get multiple location details

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Smart API Selection
- Automatically selects the correct API endpoint based on parameters
- Uses search API when query is provided
- Uses analytics/top API when no query is provided

### 2. Loading States
- Consistent loading indicators across all pages
- Spinner animation with descriptive text
- Prevents UI from showing stale data

### 3. Error Handling
- Graceful error handling with user-friendly messages
- Falls back to sample data when API fails
- Logs errors to console for debugging
- Does not crash the application

### 4. Search Functionality
- Real-time search with debouncing
- Search across multiple entity types
- Search across locations
- Case-insensitive search

### 5. Filtering
- Filter by entity type (Person, Organization, Topic, Location)
- Filter by category (High Impact, Trending)
- Filter by sentiment (when available)
- Filter by time range

### 6. Pagination
- Offset-based pagination for detail pages
- Configurable page size
- "Load more" functionality (ready for implementation)

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing
1. **Entities Page:**
   - Test search functionality
   - Test entity type filters
   - Test category filters
   - Verify loading states
   - Test error scenarios

2. **Locations Page:**
   - Test search functionality
   - Test location type filters
   - Verify loading states
   - Test error scenarios

### API Testing
1. Use the cURL examples in `API_QUICK_REFERENCE.md`
2. Test with different parameters
3. Verify response structures
4. Test error responses

### Integration Testing
1. Test with real API endpoints
2. Verify authentication works
3. Test with different user roles
4. Test with large datasets
