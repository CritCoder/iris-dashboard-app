# Profiles Detail View Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented the profile detail view functionality from osint-turbo into the new-fe project. When a profile card is clicked, it now opens a detailed view showing all posts from that profile in a new tab.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Tab-Based Navigation
- **ProfileTabBar Component**: Manages multiple tabs for switching between the profiles grid and individual profile detail views
- Tabs can be opened and closed dynamically
- First tab is always "All Profiles" (grid view) and cannot be closed
- Each profile opens in its own tab with the username as the tab title

### 2. Profile Detail View Layout (3/4 - 1/4 Split)
- **Left Column (3/4 width)**: 
  - Profile header with banner, avatar, bio, and stats
  - Post filtering tabs (Latest, Top, Positive, Negative)
  - Posts feed with infinite scroll and load more functionality
  
- **Right Column (1/4 width)**:
  - Profile statistics and analytics
  - Engagement metrics (likes, comments, shares, views)
  - Average engagement per post
  - Sentiment distribution with visual bar
  - Account information

### 3. Components Created

#### `ProfileDetailView` (`/components/profiles/profile-detail-view.tsx`)
Main component that displays profile details and posts
- Fetches profile posts from API
- Handles tab filtering (Latest, Top, Positive, Negative)
- Implements infinite scroll with "Load More" button
- Displays posts using the existing PostCard component

#### `ProfileHeader` (`/components/profiles/profile-header.tsx`)
Profile information display
- Banner image with overlay
- Avatar with platform badge
- Display name, username, verification badges
- Bio and location
- Follower/following/posts counts
- Close button to return to grid view

#### `ProfilePostTabs` (`/components/profiles/profile-post-tabs.tsx`)
Tab navigation for filtering posts
- Latest: Shows all posts in chronological order
- Top: Shows top posts
- Positive: Filters posts with positive sentiment
- Negative: Filters posts with negative sentiment

#### `ProfileStats` (`/components/profiles/profile-stats.tsx`)
Statistics and analytics panel
- Profile overview (total posts, platform info)
- Total engagement metrics
- Average engagement per post
- Sentiment distribution with visual representation
- Account type and verification status

#### `ProfileTabBar` (`/components/profiles/profile-tab-bar.tsx`)
Tab management component
- Displays all open tabs
- Highlights active tab
- Close button for individual profile tabs
- Prevents closing the main grid tab

### 4. Updated Components

#### `ProfileCard` (in `/app/profiles/page.tsx`)
- Added `onClick` prop to handle profile clicks
- Triggers tab opening when clicked
- No longer uses Link component when onClick is provided

#### `ProfilesPage` (`/app/profiles/page.tsx`)
- Added tab state management
- Implemented `handleProfileClick` to open profiles in new tabs
- Implemented `handleTabClose` to close profile tabs
- Conditional rendering: shows grid or detail view based on active tab
- Tab bar only shown when multiple tabs are open

## User Experience Flow

1. **Browse Profiles**: User sees grid of profile cards
2. **Click Profile**: Clicking any profile card opens a new tab
3. **View Details**: Profile detail view shows with header, posts, and stats
4. **Filter Posts**: User can filter posts by Latest, Top, Positive, or Negative
5. **Load More**: Scroll down or click "Load More" to see additional posts
6. **Switch Tabs**: Click tab bar to switch between grid and different profiles
7. **Close Tab**: Click X on any profile tab to close it and return to grid

## API Integration

### Endpoints Used
- `GET /api/social/profiles/{id}/posts` - Fetch posts for a specific profile
- `GET /api/social/profiles/{id}` - Fetch profile details and stats

### Parameters
- `page`: Page number for pagination
- `limit`: Number of posts per page (default: 20)
- `sentiment`: Filter by sentiment (POSITIVE, NEGATIVE)

## Technical Details

### State Management
- `tabs`: Array of open tabs (grid + profile detail tabs)
- `activeTabId`: Currently displayed tab
- Profile data passed through tab state

### Performance Optimizations
- Lazy loading of posts with pagination
- Infinite scroll with intersection observer
- Memoized statistics calculations
- Conditional component rendering

### Responsive Design
- 3/4 - 1/4 layout on desktop
- Adjusts for smaller screens
- Mobile-friendly post cards

## Files Modified/Created

### Created
- `/components/profiles/profile-detail-view.tsx`
- `/components/profiles/profile-header.tsx`
- `/components/profiles/profile-post-tabs.tsx`
- `/components/profiles/profile-stats.tsx`
- `/components/profiles/profile-tab-bar.tsx`

### Modified
- `/app/profiles/page.tsx`

## Testing Recommendations

1. Click on various profile cards to ensure tabs open correctly
2. Test tab switching between grid and multiple profiles
3. Verify post filtering (Latest, Top, Positive, Negative)
4. Test "Load More" functionality and infinite scroll
5. Check statistics calculations are accurate
6. Verify close button functionality on tabs
7. Test on different screen sizes for responsiveness

## Future Enhancements

- Add profile search within detail view
- Implement post interactions (like, comment, share)
- Add export functionality for profile data
- Cache profile data to avoid re-fetching
- Add loading skeletons for better UX
- Implement real-time updates for new posts
