## üóëÔ∏è Why These Can Be Deleted

### API Testing Files
These were used to capture and analyze API calls during development. Now that the API integration is complete and documented, these raw capture files are no longer needed.

### Test Scripts
These were temporary scripts created to test various aspects of the application during development. Proper testing is now handled by:
- Manual testing documentation (in `/manual_testing/`)
- Playwright E2E tests (in `/tests/`)

### JSON Data Dumps
These are snapshots of API responses used for debugging. They're no longer needed as the API integration is stable and documented.

## ‚úÖ Before Deleting

Make sure you've reviewed:
1. `/final_instructions/` - Contains all important documentation
2. `/manual_testing/` - Contains proper testing documentation
3. `/tests/` - Contains automated tests

If anything important is missing, retrieve it from these temporary files before deletion.

## üìä Statistics

- **Total Files**: 28
- **Disk Space**: ~2-5 MB (estimated)
- **Purpose**: Development/testing artifacts
- **Status**: No longer needed

## üí° Note

If you're unsure about deleting these files, you can:
1. Create a backup/archive
2. Move to a separate archive folder
3. Keep them for a few more weeks before deletion

However, all critical information has been preserved in:
- `/final_instructions/` - Implementation docs
- `/manual_testing/` - Testing docs
- Application code itself
