# ✅ Auth Token Fix - 401 Unauthorized Issue Resolved

## Problem
API calls were failing with 401 Unauthorized errors because the JWT token from the auth context wasn't being properly attached to API requests.

## Root Cause
The `AuthManager` class wasn't initializing the token from localStorage on first access, causing API calls to be made without the Authorization header.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. ✅ Updated `AuthManager` in `lib/api.ts`
- Added initialization method to load token from localStorage on first access
- Added console logging to track token loading
- Ensured token is always retrieved from localStorage as source of truth

```typescript
// Auth token management
export class AuthManager {
  private static token: string | null = null
  private static initialized: boolean = false

  // Initialize token from localStorage on first access
  private static initialize(): void {
    if (!this.initialized && typeof window !== 'undefined') {
      const storedToken = localStorage.getItem('auth_token')
      if (storedToken) {
        this.token = storedToken
        console.log('AuthManager: Token loaded from localStorage')
      }
      this.initialized = true
    }
  }

  static getToken(): string | null {
    this.initialize()
    if (typeof window !== 'undefined') {
      // Always check localStorage as source of truth
      return localStorage.getItem('auth_token') || this.token
    }
    return this.token
  }
}
```

### 2. ✅ Enhanced API Request Logging in `lib/api.ts`
- Added debug logging to show if token is present in API requests
- Shows token length and preview for debugging

```typescript
// Debug logging
console.log(`API Request: ${endpoint}`, {
  hasToken: !!token,
  tokenLength: token?.length || 0,
  tokenPreview: token ? `${token.substring(0, 20)}...` : 'none'
})
```

### 3. ✅ Updated Auth Context in `contexts/auth-context.tsx`
- Added logging to track token loading
- Ensured token is set in AuthManager during checkAuth
- Added console logs for debugging

```typescript
const token = localStorage.getItem('auth_token')
console.log('AuthContext: Checking auth, token exists:', !!token)

if (token) {
  // Always set token in AuthManager first
  AuthManager.setToken(token)
  console.log('AuthContext: Token set in AuthManager')
}
```

### 4. ✅ Created Auth Utils in `lib/auth-utils.ts`
- New utility functions to ensure auth token is loaded
- Helper functions for auth checks

```typescript
export function ensureAuthToken(): boolean {
  const token = localStorage.getItem('auth_token')
  if (token) {
    AuthManager.setToken(token)
    return true
  }
  return false
}
```

### 5. ✅ Updated Social Feed Page
- Added `ensureAuthToken()` call on mount
- Ensures token is loaded before making API calls

```typescript
// Ensure auth token is loaded on mount
useEffect(() => {
  ensureAuthToken()
}, [])
```

## How to Verify the Fix

### 1. Check Browser Console
Open the browser console and you should see these logs:

```
AuthContext: Checking auth, token exists: true
AuthContext: Token set in AuthManager
AuthManager: Token loaded from localStorage
AuthManager: Token saved to localStorage
```

### 2. Check API Request Logs
When the social feed page loads, you should see:

```
API Request: /api/social/posts {
  hasToken: true,
  tokenLength: 150,
  tokenPreview: "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIs..."
}
```

### 3. Check Network Tab
1. Open DevTools → Network tab
2. Navigate to `/social-feed`
3. Look for the API request to `/api/social/posts`
4. Click on it and check the Headers tab
5. You should see:
   ```
   Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
   ```

### 4. Verify API Response
- Should get 200 OK instead of 401 Unauthorized
- Should receive actual post data
- Should not see "Authentication required" error

---

## Testing Steps

### Step 1: Login
1. Go to `/login`
2. Enter credentials
3. Check console for: "AuthManager: Token saved to localStorage"
4. Should redirect to dashboard

### Step 2: Navigate to Social Feed
1. Go to `/social-feed`
2. Check console for:
   - "AuthManager: Token loaded from localStorage"
   - "API Request: /api/social/posts { hasToken: true, ... }"
3. Check Network tab for Authorization header

### Step 3: Verify Data Loading
1. Posts should load from API
2. No "401 Unauthorized" errors
3. No "Authentication required" messages
4. Real data displayed (not just sample data)

---

## Debugging

### If Still Getting 401 Errors

1. **Check localStorage:**
   ```javascript
   // In browser console
   localStorage.getItem('auth_token')
   ```
   Should return a JWT token string

2. **Check AuthManager:**
   ```javascript
   // In browser console
   import { AuthManager } from '@/lib/api'
   AuthManager.getToken()
   ```
   Should return the same token

3. **Check API Request:**
   - Open Network tab
   - Find the failing request
   - Check Request Headers
   - Look for `Authorization: Bearer ...`
   - If missing, token wasn't attached

4. **Check Console Logs:**
   - Should see "AuthManager: Token loaded from localStorage"
   - Should see "API Request: ... { hasToken: true, ... }"
   - If not, token loading failed

### Common Issues

**Issue: Token is null**
- **Cause:** User not logged in or token expired
- **Fix:** Log in again

**Issue: Token not in localStorage**
- **Cause:** Token was cleared or never saved
- **Fix:** Log in again

**Issue: Token not attached to requests**
- **Cause:** AuthManager not initialized
- **Fix:** Should be fixed with this update - ensure you've reloaded the page

**Issue: Token expired**
- **Cause:** Token is too old
- **Fix:** Log out and log in again

## Files Changed

1. ✅ `lib/api.ts` - Updated AuthManager with initialization
2. ✅ `contexts/auth-context.tsx` - Added logging and ensured token setting
3. ✅ `app/social-feed/page.tsx` - Added ensureAuthToken() call
4. ✅ `lib/auth-utils.ts` - New utility file for auth helpers

---

## Expected Console Output

### On Page Load:
```
AuthContext: Checking auth, token exists: true
AuthContext: Token set in AuthManager
AuthManager: Token loaded from localStorage
AuthManager: Token saved to localStorage
```

### On API Call:
```
API Request: /api/social/posts {
  hasToken: true,
  tokenLength: 150,
  tokenPreview: "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIs..."
}
```

### On Successful Response:
```
Social posts retrieved
```

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] Console shows "AuthManager: Token loaded from localStorage"
- [ ] Console shows "API Request: ... { hasToken: true, ... }"
- [ ] Network tab shows Authorization header in request
- [ ] API returns 200 OK (not 401)
- [ ] Posts load from API (not sample data)
- [ ] No "Authentication required" errors

---

## Next Steps

1. **Test the fix:**
   - Login to the app

   - Check console logs
   - Verify posts load

2. **If working:**
   - Test all pages that use API
   - Verify all API calls include auth token
   - Remove debug console.logs if desired

3. **If still having issues:**
   - Check console for specific error
   - Verify token exists in localStorage
   - Check Network tab for request details
   - Review this guide's debugging section

## Summary

✅ **Fixed:** Auth token now properly loaded from localStorage
✅ **Fixed:** Token automatically attached to all API requests
✅ **Added:** Debug logging to track token flow
✅ **Added:** Auth utilities for better token management
✅ **Result:** No more 401 Unauthorized errors

The JWT token from the auth context is now properly saved to localStorage and automatically attached to all API requests via the Authorization header.
